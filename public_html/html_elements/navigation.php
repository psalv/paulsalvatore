<!--

This feature will comprise of 3 navigation buttons.
They will be static on the page, appearing in the bottom left and right corners.


TODO: First start with just the left/right controls.

NOTE: going from 1 -> 3, I will need to reset the left of 3 before doing the animation (because it needs to wrap, so come from the other side)
